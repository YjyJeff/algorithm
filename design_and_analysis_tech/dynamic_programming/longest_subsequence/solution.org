* Question 
Given two sequence A and B find the longest subsequence both A and B have. The subsequence could have gaps.
* Solution
Build a 2-D array S[N][M](N and M represent the length of A and B), the element at S[i][j] defines the length of longest subsequence at B[i] to A[j]. The goal is to find 
the max value in S[i][N];
** How to calculate S[i][j]
if(B[i] == A[j]) S[i][j] == S[i-1][j-1]+1
else S[i][j] == max(S[i][j-1], S[i-1][j])

** Explain
when B[i] == A[j], wen can and should consider the subproblem of finding an LCS of A[j-1] and B[i-1].
Otherwise, we should consider the two subproblems S[i][j-1] and S[i-1][j].

** Why no code
Build this simple array is so easy.
